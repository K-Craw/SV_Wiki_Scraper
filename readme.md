To be implemented/plans:
    - Need to figure out how to search pages and get the correct critera from those pages.
        - Will need to implement some form of taking text from input strings
        - and returning the parsed text from the wiki page to get the requested data.
            -requests for different forms of data from the ame page? e.g wiki Blacksmith could return the whole page,
            wiki blacksmith help could return all the sections on his page, wiki blacksmith process_geodes could
            return info from the process geodes section.
        - figure out how to refactor to create a controller for the API calls.
        - coroutines?
        - API parsing?
